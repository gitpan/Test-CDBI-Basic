TITLE
    Test::CDBI::Basic - Very basic testing of Class::DBI classes

DESCRIPTION
    Allows for quick and dirty testing of Class::DBI classes

SYNOPSIS
            use strict;
            use warnings;

            use Test::More tests => 31;
            use Test::CDBI::Basic qw( test_class );
            use Some::DBI::Class;

            test_class( 'Sequins::DBI::Hit' );

INTRODUCTION
    This module does something very simple that I find myself doing whenever
    I write tests for Class::DBI subclasses. It reads in the class, tries to
    create a new object, and then goes through the columns, attempting to
    assign the value of 1 to every column. It doesn't check if the column
    was actually updated. Basically then, it allows you to check your column
    definitions match reality. It won't attempt to assign a value to any
    column set as a primary column. It does this in the most naive way
    possible, and then tries to delete the object created.

    It makes a call to "ok", however that's defined in the calling class,
    when an object was created, and once for every column.

FUNCTIONS
  test_class
    Accepts a class name and an optional list of arguments to be treated
    like a hash to pass to your class's "create" method.
